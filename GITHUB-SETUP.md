# How to Share This on GitHub üåê

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and share this tool with your friends!

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `copilot-cli-auto` (or whatever you want)
   - **Description:** "Autonomous GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper with auto-approval"
   - **Visibility:** Choose "Public" (so your friends can access it)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Prepare Your Local Repository

Open your terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right folder
pwd
# Should show: /path/to/copilot-cli

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Copilot CLI auto-approval wrapper"
```

## Step 3: Connect to GitHub and Push

GitHub will show you commands after creating the repo. Use these:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/copilot-cli-auto.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR-USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

## Step 4: Customize Your Repository

### Update the Main README

The repository currently has the original Copilot CLI README. You should replace it with the beginner-friendly one:

```bash
# Backup the original
mv README.md ORIGINAL-COPILOT-README.md

# Use the beginner README as the main one
cp BEGINNER-README.md README.md

# Commit the change
git add .
git commit -m "Update README for beginner-friendly documentation"
git push
```

### Add a License

Your repository already has a LICENSE.md file. You might want to update the copyright:

1. Open `LICENSE.md`
2. Update the year and your name
3. Save and commit:
```bash
git add LICENSE.md
git commit -m "Update license with my info"
git push
```

## Step 5: Make It Look Nice

### Add Topics (Tags)

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to "About"
2. Add topics like: `copilot`, `cli`, `automation`, `ai`, `github-copilot`, `nodejs`
3. Save changes

### Add a Description

In the same "About" section, add a short description:
```
Autonomous GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper with auto-approval and safety controls
```

### Add a Website Link (Optional)

You can link to the Copilot CLI docs:
```
https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli
```

## Step 6: Share with Your Friends! üéâ

Send them the link to your repository:
```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/copilot-cli-auto
```

Tell them to:
1. Read the `QUICKSTART.md` file
2. Follow the installation steps
3. Try the examples

## Optional: Add a Nice README Badge

Add this to the top of your README.md to show it's built with love:

```markdown
[![Node.js Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D22.0.0-brightgreen)](https://nodejs.org/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE.md)
[![GitHub Copilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-GitHub%20Copilot-blue)](https://github.com/features/copilot)
```

## Keeping It Updated

When you make changes:

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Making It Easy to Install

Your friends can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install -g git+https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/copilot-cli-auto.git
```

Or they can clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/copilot-cli-auto.git
cd copilot-cli-auto
npm install
npm install -g .
```

## Suggested Repository Structure

Your repository is already well-organized! Here's what you have:

```
copilot-cli-auto/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js                              # Main wrapper code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json                          # Node.js package configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                             # Main documentation (use BEGINNER-README.md)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other files from the original repo)
```
